- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALschiffman
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to write websites and apps...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, CSS and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on arduino code...
- 📫 You can contact me at alschiffman@gmail.com...

- As I learn Javascript and HTML and CSS I will be creating templates of each of the various functions to use as reference when writing more complex code. I will post these files here to help others on their learning journey as well.
Good luck!
